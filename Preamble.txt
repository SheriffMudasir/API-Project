Create the mode 
Serializes the model
register them in the admin
Implement filtering by installing django-filter, add to install apps and put it in the REST_FRAMEWORK in settings.py
Create a superuser, login as admin and add data to the data base Populate the  database
Implement pagination
Now let implement authentication, add 'rest_framework.authtoken' in settings to implement token-based auth
We add a default auth token method in the setting.py file
We add setting for throttling and implement it
Let install Djoser to implement auth, added it to the project level URLs
Djoser endpoints
_______________________
/users/
/users/me/
users/confirm/
/users/resend_activation/
/users/set_password/
/users/reset_password/
/users/reset_password/confirm
/users/set_username/
/users/reset_username
/users/reset_username_confirm/
/token/login/
/token/logout/

To make use of this endpoints add the to the  project level urls file
To enforce permission to view , 'rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated', in the settings.py and

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step plan for implementing the API, in the order you should code them:

1. Implement Authentication & User Management
Set up Djoser for user registration and token authentication.
Create the necessary URLs for:
/api/users/ â†’ Register users
/api/users/me/ â†’ Retrieve current user
/token/login/ â†’ Generate authentication tokens
2. Implement Role-Based Access Control
Define user groups in Django:
Manager â†’ Can manage menu items, users, and orders
Delivery Crew â†’ Can see assigned orders and update order status
Customer â†’ Can browse menu, place orders
Create endpoints for managing user groups:
/api/groups/manager/users/
/api/groups/delivery-crew/users/
3. Complete Menu Items Endpoints
Customers & Delivery Crew:
Can only view menu items (GET /api/menu-items/)
Managers:
Can create (POST), update (PUT/PATCH), and delete (DELETE) menu items.
4. Implement Cart Management
Customers only can:
View their cart (GET /api/cart/menu-items/)
Add items to cart (POST /api/cart/menu-items/)
Clear the cart (DELETE /api/cart/menu-items/)
5. Implement Order Management
Customers:
View their orders (GET /api/orders/)
Place orders (moves items from cart to order) (POST /api/orders/)
Managers:
View all orders (GET /api/orders/)
Assign delivery crew & update order status (PUT/PATCH /api/orders/{orderId}/)
Delete an order (DELETE /api/orders/{orderId}/)
Delivery Crew:
View assigned orders (GET /api/orders/)
Update order status (PATCH /api/orders/{orderId}/)
6. Implement Filtering, Pagination & Sorting
Add filtering, searching, and ordering to:
/api/menu-items/ (Filter by category, price, etc.)
/api/orders/ (Filter by status, date, etc.)
Add pagination for large datasets.
7. Implement Throttling
Set different request limits for:
Authenticated users
Anonymous users
Ensure API security and prevent abuse.
Final Step: Testing & Debugging
Write unit tests for API endpoints.
Test with Postman or Django Admin Panel.
Fix bugs and ensure proper status codes are returned.
